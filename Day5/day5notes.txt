class abc
{
};

class def
{
	friend class abc;
};
one class can consider another class as it's friend
int the above example, all the methods of def can access private data of abc class

Shallow copy
 
when class has pointer as a datamember,
the builtin copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator
methods copies the pointer and not the data to which it points
hence, if one object modifies the data, it is reflected in anohter
object.

namespace
to avoid name collisions
collection classes and objects
user defined namespace

Threads
thread creation faster compared to processs creation
thread termination faster compared to processs termination
thread communication faster compared to processs communication

threads within a process shares
data segment
heap segment
text segment
opened files
devices

each thread with in a process have it's 
statck segment (sp)


templates
are used to write generic programs

generic to data type
writing a code independent of data type

template,class,typename
class template:generic class
function template: generic function

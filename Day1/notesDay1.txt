Access specifiers

Members of structure can be 
private: visible with in a structure
public: visible outside a structure
protected: will be discussed during inheritance

Modularity:
applications can be divided into modules

Stack App:

stack.h
stack.c
StackApp.c

object : real world entity,which has
			identity
			state
			characteristics
			behaviour


class: blue print of an object
		 defines the characteristics and behaviour of an object
		 data (to represent state/identity..)
		 functions( member function or method)



class Car
{
	int vno;
	int gears;
	int doors;
	int currentGear;
	double speed;
	int state;

	void startEngine()
	{
	}
	void changeGear()
	{
	}
};


Types of object:

Global objects ( objects created out of any function)
Local objects ( objects created with in a function)
Heap based objects

class 
		Members: Data & methods

Function overloading (polymorphic feature)

defining multiple functions with same name

Rules of function overloading
	i) number of arguments
	ii) type of arguments
	iii) order of passing arguments
one can overload a function to any number as long as there is no confusion

Types of function
Non member function
Member function(method)

Non member function: a function which is defined outside a class
Member function(method): function defined within a class

static data
static method
const method


static data
a data which is common for all objects a particular class

initialize static data

data_type   className::varName=912;

int  Plot::cityCode = 912;


static method:

a method which can access only static data
a method which can called without object
